# Textile

It is a well known fact that one can build a personal blog, or to be more modern, a digital garden, easily using a preferred front-end framework along with a CI/CD pipeline that runs on a directory change. Oftentimes, a page would be written in Markdown. These Markdown documents can be transformed into HTML documents by the pipeline or interpreted into HTML at runtime by packages such as UnifiedJS. 

The Markdown format, while simple and convenient to use, lacks a certain "charm." More precisely, the sort of charms we often see in LaTeX documents. Naturally, some have associated LaTeX with the fields of mathematics, and therefore, have dreaded these aesthetics.

Still, it is undeniable that these documents possess certain charm and beauty. With that said, this project provides a small, but practical example to create a digital garden in which its source format is written in LaTeX.

While much of the functionalities work well without resorting to trickeries and hacks, a small part of the front-end unfortunately employs, to put it bluntly, questionable decisions. Alas, a certain degree of jank should be expected when exploring unknown territories.
