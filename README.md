## Usage

Set up content directory as submodule by creating a new repository then register it as a submodule with

```git
git submodule add https://github.com/<user>/<my-content-repo> content/
```

This will let GitHub know that the `content/` directory is a submodule and its content can be accessed by visiting the given repository.
